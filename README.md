üìÅ Find My Project ‚Äì Full Stack Web Application Documentation

Project Overview

Find My Project is a collaborative full-stack web application designed for students, professionals, and tech enthusiasts to showcase their projects, discover others' work, provide feedback, and seek collaborators. With role-based access, REST APIs, secure authentication, and cloud storage integration, the platform promotes transparency, communication, and project development.

The application uses React.js for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend and supports core features like CRUD operations, session management, file uploads, and email notifications.
